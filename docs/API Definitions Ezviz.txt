Push Message System (webhook)
1.Introduction
Webhook: a web custom callback entry that automatically calls the specified URL when some behavior is triggered by the program.
Compared with message pull mode, message push mode enables messages to reach the client system in a more real-time manner, and the complexity of the client system will be reduced (it is no longer necessary to start a scheduled task to call the message pull interface). The disadvantage is that when an exception occurs at the consumer end, the message producer continues to produce messages. Even though we have a retry mechanism, the messages may still be lost due to the limited number of retries.
Because of the characteristics of webhook, when a large number of messages are generated, the message throughput mainly depends on the processing efficiency of the customer webhook message processing service. To ensure the quality of service, the timeout period set for each message push request is 2 seconds. After the processing timeout, it is considered to have failed to send this message. If the retry mechanism is configured, the message will be sent again using the retry mechanism. If the maximum number of retries fails, the message will be discarded and will not be pushed again. It is recommended that developers quickly write the push messages into their own message queue after receiving them to improve the message receiving ability.
Please contact us via email open-team@ezvizlife.com if you'd like receive the message from camera and sensor through message service.

Security
1. The customer must provide https url as the webhook address;
2. If the signing key is provided when the service is opened, the push request header contains the signature of the message body (the customer verifies the signature after receiving the message); Signature method?signature=hmac_sha1(HTTP request body+ time stamp, secret configured when the customer enables the message push)
3. Cautions
1. The customer system must design and implement the deployment of the webhook message processing service according to its own device message volume. If the customer webhook message service has insufficient processing capability and causes its own system failure, messages may be lost (a retry mechanism can be configured to retry, but the timeliness will decline, and if the failure lasts too long, the messages may still be lost). It is recommended that the webhook message processing service implemented by the customer directly forwards the push messages to the persistent message queue when receiving them, and then the later business system will consume these messages for business logic processing, so as to improve the efficiency of webhook message pushing and receiving.
2. The timeout period of the push is 2 seconds. If the customer webhook service takes more than 2 seconds to process the push message, the push will be considered as a failure and the subsequent processing operations for the push failure will be performed.
3. If the customer webhook message processing service needs the whole cluster to be shut down for upgrading (the service is completely unavailable), there is a risk of message loss. Therefore, if the whole cluster is shut down for maintenance, a processing plan should be prepared.
4. Information Provided When Webhook Is Enabled
1. Webhook callback address
2. Push message type (eg?ys.alarm / ys.open.isapi / ys.calling / ys.onoffline / ys.open.ram / ys.iot / ys.auth.update)
3. Signing key (optional)
4. Maximum number of retries for push failure (optional, value range: 1~3)
5. Email address for service downgrade notification (optional)
Appendix 1: Signature sample code (java version)
public static String hmacSha1(String key, String data, Charset bytesEncode) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {
    SecretKeySpec signingKey = new SecretKeySpec(key.getBytes(bytesEncode), "HmacSHA1");
    Mac mac = Mac.getInstance("HmacSHA1");
    mac.init(signingKey);
    // General method, just implement it yourself (from byte[] to hex string)
    return byteToHexString(mac.doFinal(data.getBytes(bytesEncode)));
}

...
String secret = ... ;//Signing key
String body = ...; //HTTP request body
String timestamp = ...; //HTTP header?field?t
//Verify signature
signature.equals(hmacSha1(secret, body + timestamp, StandardCharsets.UTF_8))
Appendix 2: Callback address receiving template
@RequestMapping(value = "/webhook")
public ResponseEntity<String> webhook(@RequestHeader HttpHeaders header, @RequestBody String body) {
    final List<String> t = header.get("t");
    WebhookMessage receiveMessage = null;
    log.info("Message acquisition time:{}, request header:{},request body:{}",System.currentTimeMillis(),JSON.toJSONString(header),body);
    System.out.println("Message received:"+body);
    try {
        receiveMessage = JSON.parseObject(body, WebhookMessage.class);
        //todo: Process the received message. It is better to send it to other middleware or write it to the database, without affecting the processing of the callback address

    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();

    Map<String, String> result = new HashMap<>(1);

Function Description For The Sub Account Of B (Big Account )
Opening the function of subaccount of platform B (large account) the main is aimed at controlling the B (large account) mode developer account permissions. With this function, the sub account can be created within the permissions of developer account, and different permission is assigned to the corresponding subaccount
Why use sub account
One of the core issues that a sub account needs to address is how to safely authorize other people to access devices without exposing the AccessToken of the B (big account) model developer. Because once the developer's AccessToken is exposed, there is a security risk, and others can have access to all of the device resources of the developer.
However, the sub account function is a long-term effective mechanism of access control, and by separating sub account with different permissions, different permissions will be assigned to different users. In this case, once the sub account leak ,it will not cause global information disclosure.
Basic concepts
The following is a brief explanation of some basic concepts: sub account: It is a sub account created from developer accounts with the EZVIZ open platform. when creating sub account ,the developer can set different permission and passwords .when created, each sub account has a ID.
* Authorization policy: a rule used to define permissions, such as previewing a device.
* Resource: a resource that a user can access, such as a device with a serial number of 469631729, or a first channel of a device with a serial number of 469631729.
Application scenarios
If you buy some EZVIZ devises or other Hikvision devises with EZVIZ protocol and all the devises are used with the account of developer ,the users who have an access to these devises will be exposed to using the AccessToken created from the developer account Here's the problem: you can't control the privileges of the devices that a particular user can access.
Here is the solution: rights control can be achieved through the function of sub account. The developer account is called the primary account while account recreated is called a sub account. The sub account can only use the operations and equipment resources authorized by the master account.
Application scenarios of sub account
the scene of educational institution video surveillance system is taken for example. a kindergarten has ten classrooms, and each classroom has 2 EZVIZ cameras, while the kindergarten administrator has these 20 EZVIZ equipment ownership. An APP has been developed and integrated OpenSDK in a The kindergarten, and with the help of this APP, these parents will be able to see video in the class. Once the parents register on this APP ,the kindergarten administrators assign corresponding classroom permissions to the parents to see own their children ,and PTZ control, video encryption can not be operated. 

Details of the scheme are described below?
1. User register on this APP . App users are terminal ones ,and they are user of developer. And they have nothing to do with EZVIZ cloud or its platform account.
2. Create sub accounts. For every valid App users, App Server can define each App user access permissions (described by the Policy grammar); for every App user has access to specify a sub account, if there is no, it need to create a specified access sub accounts. correspondence between App users and sub accounts will be saved in App server.
The sub account can be created with the open platform of EZVIZ via an interface, and terminal user are not aware of the sub account .
In this scenario, a sub account of "" parents in classroom A " will be created and authorized to check theinformation of devices and to live view and playback. However, the sub account just have the access to C6(519928976)?C2C(470686804)
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Permission": "Get,Real,Replay",
            "Resource": [
                "dev:519928976",
                "dev:470686804"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
3. log in with account
4. The App Server recognize the corresponding sub account of this App user,and request the EZVIZ cloud to offer the platform and gain a Access Token in class A
5. the opening platform of EZVIZ give back a valid voucher with expiration time and Access Token to App Server.
6. App Server returns the access credentials to the Client App. while Client App can buffer this Access Token. When Access Token fails, Client App needs to apply for a new Access Token from App Server.
7. Client App uses Access Token to request EZVIZ opening platform API (including the Open SDK interface and the Http interface). EZVIZ opening platform verifies that the sub account has access to the device in accordance with the Access Token in the request parameter, and only the requests that meet the minimum permissions required by the API interface are allowed. If the user queries the device list, the cloud platform will only return the device information gained by sub account with corresponding access
In this scenario, the user will check device list, and cloud platform only return back the information of equipment C6 (519928976), C2C (470686804); if other equipment or this 2 equipment is operated with the PTZ control, video encryption, cloud platform will return to the error code “no access”
Sub account authorization policy (Policy) configuration
There is a Statement in Policy (one can have multiple Statement in Policy). And the Statement specifies the corresponding Permission, Resource. 
The following is an example of an authorization policy (Policy):
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Permission": "Get,Update,DevCtrl",
            "Resource": [
                "dev:469631729",
                "cam:544229080:1"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Permission": "Get,Real",
            "Resource": [
                "dev:470686804"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
The Policy licensed 469631729, 544229080, 470686804 and other equipment resources under the developer EZVIZ account, and it supported Get, Update, DevCtrl, and Real respectively.
Configuration details
Statement
“Statement” describes the authorization semantics, and each contains descriptions of Permission and Resource. Each request system will check matches one by one, and if the matches are successful, the request can pass the authentication. If none matches successfully, the request will be denied .
Permission
Includes the following permissions:
PermissionResource typeDescriptionUpdatedev?camModify resources, such as modifying device names and channel namesGetdev?camCheck resource information, including configuration information, etc.DevCtrldev?camComplete control of the equipment, including Real, Replay, Alarm, Capture, Video, Ptz, Upgrade, Format, Pipe, Config and other defined device operating rights and defined device operating rights laterRealdev?camlive viewReplaydev?camVideo playback (including local video playback and cloud storage playback)AlarmdevGet the device alarm information and subscribe to the alert messageCapturedev?camCaptureVideodev?camRecordingPtzdev?camPTZ controlUpgradedevUpgradingFormatdevFormat the diskPipedevUsing open platform transparent channel functionConfigdev?camConfigurate the device, such as video encryption, disarm association between NVR and IPCComment: in this version, the sub-account does not have add/delete device permission; sub-account can send request of add/delete device to developer, developer add/delete device.
Resource
Resource usually means the operation object, like device, channel, we use the following format to name the resource, {resourceType}:{resourceId}?
* resourceType: the type of resource, there are only two types, dev(device), cam(channel)?
* resourceId?the ID of resource, resourceId of dev type is serial number, resourceId of cam is serial number: channel number.
Subordinate relations
Cam resource belongs to dev resource, the sub-account’s permission to dev resource can pass to cam resource. For instant, there are two resources, dev: 544229080 and cam: 544229080:1, cam: 544229080:1 belongs to dev: 544229080; If the developer give the real permission of dev: 544229080 resource to sub-account, then this sub-account has the real permission for cam: 544229080:1.
























Policy Structure Introduction
Policy structure includes authorization sentence list. Every authorization sentence includes permission and resource.

Support JSON format description
For now, it only supports JSON format description. When you create or update policy, the cloud check if JSON format is correct or not. About JSON grammar, please see RFC 7159. Users can also use some online JSON format checker or editor to test the JSON text’s validity
Policy grammar
Grammar description symbol instruction ?
1. the JSON symbol of Policy?
   { } [ ] " , :
2. special symbol of grammar:
   = < > ( ) |
3. when an element has multiple values, use comma and ellipsis:
   [<resource_string>, <resource_string>, ...]
4. the elements between double quotation marks is string?
   <permission_block> = "Permission" : "<permission_string>, <permission_string>, ..."
grammar description ?
policy  = {
     <statement_block>
}

<statement_block> = "Statement" : [ <statement>, <statement>, ... ]

<statement> = {
    <permission_block>,
    <resource_block>
}

<permission_block> = "Permission" : "<permission_string>, <permission_string>, ..."

<resource_block> = "Resource" : [<resource_string>, <resource_string>, ...]
Policy grammar description?
* A policy can has many statement?
* in one statement, permission is a string support multiple authorizations, resource is a list which support multiple objects?
Permission
permission supports multiple values, the values must be accepted at ezviz platform?
PermissionResource typedescriptionUpdatedev?camEdit resource, for example, edit device’s name, channel nameGetdev?camSearch resource information, includes configurationDevCtrldev?camDevice control all, includes, Real?Replay?Alarm?Capture?Video?Ptz?Upgrade?Format?Pipe?Config and other defined device operation permissions and the device operation permissions which will be defined in the future.Realdev?camlive viewReplaydev?camPlay back (includes local, and cloud)AlarmdevAccess device alarm information, subscribe alarm informationCapturedev?camcaptureVideodev?camrecordingPtzdev?camcloud controlUpgradedevupgradeFormatdevFormat the diskPipedevUsing EZVIZ transparent channel functionConfigdev?camConfigure device, like encrypt video, disarm, link NVR and IPC etc.Comment: in this version, the sub-account does not have add/delete device permission; sub-account can send request of add/delete device to developer, developer add/delete device.
Example? "Permission": "Get,Update,DevCtrl"
Resource
Resource usually means the operation object, like device, channel, we use the following format to name the resource {resourceType}:{resourceId}
Format Description:
* • resourceType: the type of resource, there are only two types, dev(device), cam(channel);
* • resourceId: the ID of resource, resourceId of dev type is serial number, resourceId of cam is serial number: channel number.
Example?"Resource": ["dev:469631729","cam:544229080:1"].
Policy example
The following Policy includes two statements: first statement allows device 469631729 and 544229080:1 channels get resource information, Update, Real, Replay permissions. The second statement allows to get device 470686804 information and real view.
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Permission": "Get,Update,Real,Replay",
            "Resource": [
                "dev:469631729",
                "cam:544229080:1"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Permission": "Get,Real",
            "Resource": [
                "dev:470686804"
            ]
        }
    ]
